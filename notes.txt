leftAnkle rightAnkle PoseNet gives you x and y coordinates of your right eye, left eye, nose, etc. Using these coordinates you can do a number of amazing things like drawing red dots, images, and many more things. You can see the red dot on your eyes, nose, ears, etc, this means the PoseNet Netmodel or Neural Network is identifying the LOCATION of different body parts for eg. right eye's location in terms of x and y coordinates is calculated realtime and then highlighted with a red dot. This is how all the filters in snapchat or instagram work. These apps use neural network to identify the location of different parts of your face for eg. eyes. So once the app gets the locations of your right and left eyes the app puts a filter at those locations. Here filters are nothing but images of different object(s) eg. goggles.
